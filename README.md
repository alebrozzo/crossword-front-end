This is the front end project for a crosswords creation application. The user indicates the horizontal and vertical sizes, and places black boxes on the puzzle. Then the user requests the back end (this project)  for a list of horizontal and vertical words that can fit in the crossword, and their definitions.

This project is build using React 16 (bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).)
